# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript. It was developed as part of a learning exercise to practice and demonstrate key JavaScript concepts.

## Learning Objectives

The primary focus of this project was to gain hands-on experience with the following JavaScript concepts:

1. **Closures**: Utilizing closures to create private state and encapsulation.
2. **Modules**: Implementing the module pattern to organize code and maintain separation of concerns.
3. **Factory Functions**: Using factory functions to create objects with shared behavior.
4. **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with the Document Object Model to create a dynamic user interface.

Additional concepts explored:

- Event handling
- State management
- Conditional rendering

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several key components:

- `Gameboard`: Manages the game state and logic.
- `Cell`: Represents individual cells on the game board.
- `GameController`: Controls the flow of the game, including turns and win conditions.
- `ScreenController`: Handles the user interface and DOM interactions.

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 game board
- Two-player gameplay
- Custom player names
- Win and tie detection
- Option to restart the game

## Reflections

This project served as a practical application of JavaScript concepts, particularly focusing on closures, modules, and factory functions. While Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) were part of the learning objectives, they were not explicitly used in this implementation. Instead, similar encapsulation was achieved through the module pattern and function scope.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement include:
- Implementing an AI opponent
- Adding a score tracking system
- Exploring more advanced JavaScript features and optimizations

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by and built upon the curriculum provided by The Odin Project. The core structure was guided by their resources, with personal modifications and enhancements added to the game logic and user interface.
